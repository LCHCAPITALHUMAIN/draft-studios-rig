## ColdFusion + ReactJS: Expanding Horizons Through Interactivity Programming

Here lies the code that we'll be putting together at Adobe ColdFusion Summit 2018. It's the meat and potatoes of the website that we're actively developing to replace our dot com. It addresses all the main mechanics of the app without many of the pretty assets. The goal was to convey the key takeaways in digestible nuggets.

If you're itching for the full-fledged version, you can peek at our live development at [http://draftstudios.com/#whatwedo](http://draftstudios.com/#whatwedo).

Expect the repository of this code and assets to be published shortly!
